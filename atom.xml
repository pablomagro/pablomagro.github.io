In this case, you can create a CloudWatch alarm that monitors the CPU utilization metric of the EC2 instance. When the CPU utilization reaches 100%, the alarm will be triggered, and you can configure actions such as sending notifications or executing automated actions to address the unresponsiveness issue.</p><h3 id="👀-For-each-production-EC2-instance-create-an-Amazon-CloudWatch-alarm-for-Status-Check-Failed-System-Set-the-alarm-action-to-recover-the-EC2-instance-Configure-the-alarm-notification-to-be-published-to-an-Amazon-Simple-Notification-Service-Amazon-SNS-topic"><a href="#👀-For-each-production-EC2-instance-create-an-Amazon-CloudWatch-alarm-for-Status-Check-Failed-System-Set-the-alarm-action-to-recover-the-EC2-instance-Configure-the-alarm-notification-to-be-published-to-an-Amazon-Simple-Notification-Service-Amazon-SNS-topic" class="headerlink" title="👀 For each production EC2 instance, create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm for Status Check Failed: System. Set the alarm action to recover the EC2 instance.

Set the alarm action to <code>recover the EC2 instance</code>. Configure the alarm notification to be published to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic.</h3><p><code>Explanation</code>: By creating a <code>CloudWatch alarm</code> for Status <code>Check Failed: System</code>, you can<code> automate the recovery task of EC2 instances</code> (<code>stop, terminate, reboot, or recover your Amazon EC2 instances</code>). When the system health check fails for an EC2 instance, the alarm will be triggered and perform the configured action to recover the instance. This eliminates the need for manual intervention. Additionally, configuring the alarm to publish notifications to an SNS topic allows you to receive notifications whenever a system health check fails.</p><h3 id="Metrics"><a href="#Metrics" class="headerlink" title="Metrics"></a>Metrics</h3><h4 id="Determine-which-instance-use-the-most-bandwidth"><a href="#Determine-which-instance-use-the-most-bandwidth" class="headerlink" title="Determine which instance use the most bandwidth"></a>Determine which instance use the most bandwidth</h4><p><code>NetworkIn</code> <code>and NetworkOut</code></p><h4 id="Identify-the-processing-power-required"><a href="#Identify-the-processing-power-required" class="headerlink" title="Identify the processing power required"></a>Identify the processing power required</h4><p><code>👀</code> <code>CPUUtilization</code> specifies the percentage of allocated EC2 compute units that are currently in use on the instance.

You can choose a fixed rate to create a snapshot every few minutes or use a cron expression to specify that the snapshot is made at a specific time of day.</p><p>Snapshots are incremental backups, which means that only the blocks on the device that have changed after your most recent snapshot are saved. This minimizes the time required to create the snapshot and saves on storage costs by not duplicating data. Each snapshot contains all of the information that is needed to restore your data (from the moment when the snapshot was taken) to a new EBS volume.</p><p>Reference: <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/TakeScheduledSnapshot.html">Schedule Automated Amazon EBS Snapshots Using CloudWatch Events</a></p><h3 id="Q-Filters"><a href="#Q-Filters" class="headerlink" title="*Q Filters"></a>*Q <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/MonitoringLogData.html">Filters</a></h3><p>You can create a <code>count</code> of <code>404</code> errors <code>and exclude</code> other <code>4xx</code> errors with a filter pattern on 404 errors.</p><h3 id="Agents"><a href="#Agents" class="headerlink" title="Agents"></a>Agents</h3><h4 id="Custom-Metrics"><a href="#Custom-Metrics" class="headerlink" title="Custom Metrics"></a>Custom Metrics</h4><p>You can retrieve custom metrics from your applications or services using the <code>StatsD</code> and <code>collectd</code> protocols.

These scripts perform tasks such as navigating through a website, clicking on specific elements, submitting forms, and validating responses. By executing these predefined actions, canaries can monitor the functionality, responsiveness, and performance of an application or API.</p><p>CloudWatch Synthetics canaries collect data on metrics like response time, latency, availability, and success rates.

You can view statistical graphs of your published metrics with the AWS Management Console. CloudWatch stores data about a metric as a series of data points. Each data point has an associated time stamp. You can even publish an aggregated set of data points called a statistic set.</p><p>The <code>put-metric-data</code> <code>command</code> publishes metric data to Amazon CloudWatch, which associates it with the specified metric. If the specified metric does not exist, CloudWatch creates the metric which can take up to fifteen minutes for the metric to appear in calls to <code>ListMetrics</code>.</p><h2 id="CloudTrail"><a href="#CloudTrail" class="headerlink" title="CloudTrail"></a>CloudTrail</h2><h3 id="Q-To-ensure-that-SysOps-administrators-can-easily-verify-that-the-CloudTrail-log-files-have-not-been-deleted-or-changed-the-following-action-should-be-taken"><a href="#Q-To-ensure-that-SysOps-administrators-can-easily-verify-that-the-CloudTrail-log-files-have-not-been-deleted-or-changed-the-following-action-should-be-taken" class="headerlink" title="Q.

It provides detailed <code>inventory</code> and <code>configuration</code> history of your resources, as well as configuration change notifications. With AWS Config, you can track the configuration of your S3 bucket, including its bucket policy.</p><p>AWS Config rules use AWS Lambda functions to perform the compliance evaluations, and the Lambda functions return the compliance status of the evaluated resources as compliant or noncompliant. The non-compliant resources are remediated using the remediation action associated with the AWS Config rule. With the Auto-Remediation feature of AWS Config rules, the remediation action can be executed automatically when a resource is found non-compliant.</p><p><code>AWS Config Auto Remediation feature</code> has auto remediate feature for any non-compliant S3 buckets using the following AWS Config rules:s3-bucket-logging-enabled s3-bucket-server-side-encryption-enabled s3-bucket-public-read-prohibited s3-bucket-public-write-prohibitedThese AWS Config rules act as controls to prevent any non-compliant S3 activities.</p><h2 id="Q-AWS-Inspector"><a href="#Q-AWS-Inspector" class="headerlink" title="*Q AWS Inspector"></a><code>*Q</code> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/inspector/">AWS Inspector</a></h2><p>Amazon Inspector is <code>used for security compliance of instances and applications</code>.</p><p>Amazon Inspector is an automated security assessment service that helps you <code>test</code> the <code>network accessibility</code> of your Amazon EC2 instances and the <code>security state of your applications running on the instances</code>.</p><p>An Amazon Inspector assessment report can be generated for an assessment run once it has been successfully completed. An assessment report is a document that details what is tested in the assessment run, and the results of the assessment. The results of your assessment are formatted into a standard report, which can be generated to share results within your team for remediation actions, to enrich compliance audit data, or to store for future reference.</p><p>You can select from two types of report for your assessment, a findings report or a full report. The findings report contains an executive summary of the assessment, the instances targeted, the rules packages tested, the rules that generated findings, and detailed information about each of these rules along with the list of instances that failed the check.

This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you’d operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS.</p><p><code>enableDnsHostnames</code> – Indicates whether the instances launched in the VPC get public DNS hostnames. If this attribute is true, instances in the VPC get public DNS hostnames, but only <code>if</code> the <code>enableDnsSupport</code> attribute is also set to <code>true</code>.</p><p><code>enableDnsSupport</code> – Indicates whether the DNS resolution is supported for the VPC. If this attribute is false, the Amazon-provided DNS server in the VPC that resolves public DNS hostnames to IP addresses is not enabled. If this attribute is true, queries to the Amazon provided DNS server at the 169.254.169.253 IP address, or the reserved IP address at the base of the VPC IPv4 network range plus two will succeed.</p><p>By default, both attributes are set to <code>true</code> in a default VPC or a VPC created by the VPC wizard. By default, only the <code>enableDnsSupport</code> attribute is set to true in a VPC created on the Your VPCs page of the VPC console or using the AWS CLI, API, or an AWS SDK.</p><h3 id="Configuration"><a href="#Configuration" class="headerlink" title="Configuration"></a>Configuration</h3><p><code>Regardless of the type of subnet, the internal IPv4 address range of the subnet is always private</code>. AWS never announces these address blocks to the internet.</p><p><code>When you create a VPC, you must specify a range of IPv4 addresses for the VPC</code> in the form of a Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block; for example, 10.0.0.0&#x2F;16. This is the primary CIDR block for your VPC.</p><p><code>Subnets created in a VPC can communicate with each other</code>, this is default behaviour. The main route table facilitates this communication.</p><p>Reference: <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/how-it-works.html">How Amazon VPC works</a></p><h3 id="Connect-the-Lambda-function-to-a-private-subnet-that-has-a-route-to-a-NAT-gateway-deployed-in-a-public-subnet-of-the-VPC"><a href="#Connect-the-Lambda-function-to-a-private-subnet-that-has-a-route-to-a-NAT-gateway-deployed-in-a-public-subnet-of-the-VPC" class="headerlink" title="Connect the Lambda function to a private subnet that has a route to a NAT gateway deployed in a public subnet of the VPC."></a>Connect the Lambda function to a private subnet that has a route to a NAT gateway deployed in a public subnet of the VPC.</h3><p><code>Explanation</code>: By connecting the Lambda function to a private subnet with a route to a NAT gateway, the function can access resources within the VPC while also leveraging the NAT gateway to access the internet and communicate with third-party APIs. The NAT gateway acts as a bridge between the private subnet and the internet, allowing the Lambda function to securely access external resources.</p><h3 id="VPC-Endpoint"><a href="#VPC-Endpoint" class="headerlink" title="VPC Endpoint"></a>VPC Endpoint</h3><p>A VPC Endpoint allows you to <code>connect</code> your <code>VPC</code> directly <code>to AWS services</code> without the need for <code>internet gateways</code>, <code>NAT gateways</code>, or <code>VPN connections</code>. It enables private communication between your VPC and the AWS service without going over the internet.</p><p>To configure a VPC Endpoint for accessing AWS Systems Manager APIs, you can follow these steps:</p><ol><li>Create a VPC Endpoint for AWS Systems Manager in your Amazon VPC. This creates an elastic network interface with a private IP address within your VPC.</li><li>Update the route tables in your VPC to route traffic destined for the AWS Systems Manager API endpoints to the VPC Endpoint. This ensures that traffic is directed through the VPC Endpoint instead of going over the internet.</li><li>Verify that your on-premises instances and AWS managed instances are configured to use the appropriate VPC and route tables.</li></ol><h3 id="Egress-only-Internet-Gateway"><a href="#Egress-only-Internet-Gateway" class="headerlink" title="Egress-only Internet Gateway"></a>Egress-only Internet Gateway</h3><p>An egress-only internet gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows outbound communication over IPv6 from instances in your VPC to the internet, and prevents the internet from initiating an IPv6 connection with your instances.</p><p>An egress-only internet gateway is for use with <code>IPv6 traffic only</code>. To enable outbound-only internet communication <code>over IPv4</code>, use a <code>NAT gateway</code> instead.</p><p>Reference: <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/egress-only-internet-gateway.html">Enable outbound IPv6 traffic using an egress-only internet gateway</a></p><h3 id="Carrier-gateway"><a href="#Carrier-gateway" class="headerlink" title="Carrier gateway"></a>Carrier gateway</h3><p>A Carrier gateway is a highly available virtual appliance that <code>provides outbound IPv6 internet connectivity for instances in your VPC</code>. It acts as a gateway between your VPC and the internet, <code>allowing</code> IPv6 <code>traffic</code> to flow <code>in and out</code> of your <code>VPC</code>. By configuring a Carrier gateway, you can enable outbound communication over IPv6 for the EC2 instances in the private subnets while keeping them isolated from direct internet access.</p><h2 id="Security-Group"><a href="#Security-Group" class="headerlink" title="Security Group"></a>Security Group</h2><h3 id="The-reason-for-the-issue-where-the-new-EC2-instances-are-unable-to-mount-the-Amazon-EFS-file-system-in-a-new-Availability-Zone-could-be"><a href="#The-reason-for-the-issue-where-the-new-EC2-instances-are-unable-to-mount-the-Amazon-EFS-file-system-in-a-new-Availability-Zone-could-be" class="headerlink" title="The reason for the issue where the new EC2 instances are unable to mount the Amazon EFS file system in a new Availability Zone could be:"></a>The reason for the issue where the new EC2 instances are unable to mount the Amazon EFS file system in a new Availability Zone could be:</h3><p>The security group for the mount target does not allow inbound NFS connections from the security group used by the EC2 instances.</p><p><code>Explanation</code>: When mounting an Amazon EFS file system from EC2 instances, the security group associated with the mount target should allow inbound NFS (Network File System) connections from the security group used by the EC2 instances. By default, the security group associated with the mount target allows inbound connections from the default security group of the VPC. If the EC2 instances are using a different security group, it needs to be added to the mount target’s security group’s inbound rules to allow NFS connections.</p><h2 id="CloudFormation"><a href="#CloudFormation" class="headerlink" title="CloudFormation"></a>CloudFormation</h2><h3 id="StackSets"><a href="#StackSets" class="headerlink" title="StackSets"></a>StackSets</h3><h4 id="Use-AWS-CloudFormation-StackSets-for-Multiple-Accounts-in-an-AWS-Organization"><a href="#Use-AWS-CloudFormation-StackSets-for-Multiple-Accounts-in-an-AWS-Organization" class="headerlink" title="Use AWS CloudFormation StackSets for Multiple Accounts in an AWS Organization:"></a><code>Use</code> AWS CloudFormation <code>StackSets for Multiple Accounts in an AWS Organization</code>:</h4><p>Use AWS CloudFormation <code>StackSets</code> to <code>deploy a template</code> to <code>each account</code> to create the new IAM roles.</p><p><code>Explanation</code>: AWS CloudFormation StackSets allows you to deploy a CloudFormation template across multiple AWS accounts.

At regular intervals that you specify, Route 53 submits automated requests over the internet to your application, server, or other resources to verify that it’s reachable, available, and functional. Optionally, you can configure the health check to make requests similar to those that your users make, such as requesting a web page from a specific URL.</li><li><code>Health checks that monitor other health checks</code> (calculated health checks) – You can create a health check that monitors whether Route 53 considers other health checks healthy or unhealthy. One situation where this might be useful is when you have multiple resources that perform the same function, such as multiple web servers, and your chief concern is whether some minimum number of your resources are healthy. You can create a  health check for each resource without configuring notifications for those health checks. Then you can create a health check that monitors the status of the other health checks, and that notifies you only when the number of available web resources drops below a specified threshold.</li><li><code>Health checks that monitor CloudWatch alarms</code> – You can create CloudWatch alarms that monitor the status of CloudWatch metrics, such as the number of throttled read events for an Amazon DynamoDB database or the number of Elastic Load Balancing hosts that are considered healthy. After you create an alarm, you can create a health check that monitors the same data stream that CloudWatch monitors for the alarm.</li></ol><h3 id="“Evaluate-Target-Health”"><a href="#“Evaluate-Target-Health”" class="headerlink" title="“Evaluate Target Health”"></a>“Evaluate Target Health”</h3><p>You need to set the “Evaluate Target Health” <code>flag</code> to <code>true</code> on Route 53.

For example, you can tell React to reuse a cached calculation or to skip a re-render if the data has not changed since the previous render.</p><p>To skip calculations and unnecessary re-rendering, use one of these Hooks:</p><ul><li><a href="https://react.dev/reference/react/useMemo">useMemo</a> lets you cache the result of an expensive calculation.</li><li><a href="https://react.dev/reference/react/useCallback">useCallback</a> lets you cache a function definition before passing it down to an optimized component.</li></ul><p>Sometimes, you can’t skip re-rendering because the screen actually needs to update. In that case, you can improve performance by separating blocking updates that must be synchronous (like typing into an input) from non-blocking updates which don’t need to block the user interface (like updating a chart).</p><p>To prioritize rendering, use one of these Hooks:</p><ul><li><a href="https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition">useTransition</a> lets you mark a state transition
